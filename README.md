"# JobPortalAI" 
# 🎯 JobPortal System

A full-stack JobPortal application designed to streamline the job application process for students and recruiters — with a focus on transparency and real-time feedback.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In most job application processes, students apply for roles via platforms or directly to companies — but often receive **no feedback**. This lack of transparency creates confusion and frustration.

### ✅ Solution

This platform introduces **two distinct dashboards**:
- 🎓 **Student Dashboard**
- 🧑‍💼 **Recruiter Dashboard**

---

##  Features

### 👩‍🎓 Student Dashboard
- Browse all listed companies
- View how many jobs each company has posted
- Apply for jobs with a single click
- Track your application status:
  - `Pending`
  - `Selected`
  - `Rejected` (with reason/feedback)
- Receive real-time updates and notifications

### 🧑‍💼 Recruiter Dashboard
- Post new job opportunities
- View and manage all applications
- Update application status (`Pending`, `Selected`, `Rejected`)
- Provide feedback for each application
- View total number of applications per job post
